    <p style="text-align: left;">Most of our electricity comes from power stations that use fossil fuels like coal and oil. 
        The power stations burn the fossil fuels to make our electricity and in that process a LOT of greenhouse gas is made, 
        including carbon dioxide and methane. This is why they are called dirty sources of energy.
    </p>
        
    <p>
    It is the greenhouse gases that are causing the Earth's atmosphere to warm, which scientists tell us will cause the climate to change. 
    It is understood that this will cause more extreme weather, the spread of diseases and threaten the habitat of all living things.

                Most people are familiar with solar applications.
                These systems capture the sun’s energy and turn 
                it into energy that you can use to heat or cool your home, heat water, 
                 or make electricity.

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJDyIOtr5yA"><i>Small Wind Systems</i></a> are used to harness the power of wind to produce electricity. Wind energy has been around for a really long time (think Dutch windmills, for example), but ironically, small wind systems receive less “air time” today than solar applications. That’s unfortunate, because in areas where there are 7-12 mph winds – places like coastal locations, hilly areas and open plains — small wind systems are extremely efficient at producing electricity.

        Geothermal Systems use the constant temperature of the ground just below the Earth’s surface to heat and cool homes and businesses, and produce hot water. Geothermal systems are less well-known than solar and wind, but they are equally effective and are growing in popularity. Geothermal systems use a pump to transfer warmer ground temperatures indoors during the colder months, and cooler ground temperatures indoors the warmer months. In addition to heating and cooling homes and businesses, geothermal systems can also produce hot water.
        Things from the earth can also be used to generate energy. Biomass & Biofuel Heating Systems use biomass materials such as wood chips, logs, etc. or biofuels (sourced from used cooking oils or processed wood / farm waste, algae, etc.) to provide space and water heating. These systems can range from basic wood burning stoves to more modern, automated systems. There are also Combined Heat & Power (microCHP) Systems, which are highly efficient and use natural gas or hydrogen to simultaneously generate electricity and provide space heating and hot water.
